     <p>The March for Science Hawaiʻi celebrates the scientific process <em>mai ka lewa lani i luna a ka papakū i lalo loa</em> (from the heavens above to the earth below). We celebrate science as a foundation to explore life, understand the universe, foster global well-being, and advocate for it to be open, inclusive, and accessible.</p> 
     
     <div style="font-size: 0.7em">
       <p>We encourage people to recognize, appreciate, and engage with science and technology to ensure the long-term sustainability of our ‘āina and the impact of science in our daily lives.</p>
       <p>We seek to build and sustain a diverse and inclusive scientific community of all scientists, teachers, practitioners, and other stakeholders.</p>
       <p>We believe that scientists must be allowed to communicate their results freely, without misrepresentation, distortion, or fear of retribution.</p>
       <p>We support science education that teaches children and adults to think critically, ask questions, and evaluate truth based on the weight of evidence.</p>
       <p>We advocate political decision-making that makes use of validated knowledge-systems, evidence, and scientific consensus.</p>
